# 🐨 Code of Conduct
Check out [this project's Code of Conduct](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to make sure your contributions are staying in line with the
friendly and inclusive environment we are trying to build 😃


# 🎁 How to Contribute
There are many ways to help out with the project, even if you
are not technically savvy! 

## 1. Reporting Bugs 👾
If you run into any bugs in the client while you're playing the
game, we'd love it if you let us know about them! We are eager to
improve the experience of playing the game, and so fixing bugs
is a high priority!

When submitting a bug report, please include the following
information so that we have the best chance of fixing it:

1. A **clear, descriptive title** for your issue.

2. A clear description of **what you expected to happen**, and
   **what actually happened**.

3. The **browser and operating system versions** you
   were using when you ran into the bug.

4. A clear set of **steps to reproduce the problem**. This is
   really important so that we can investigate the bug further.

Thanks for helping us keep The Royal Game of Ur bug-free!


## 2. Suggesting New Features ✨
We'd love to hear from you about ways in which you think we can
improve the game! 

When submitting a feature request, please include the following:

1. A **clear, descriptive title** for the issue.

2. A clear description of **what the current behavior is**, and
   **what behaviour you would like to see instead**.

3. If possible, **screenshots or GIFs** are very helpful tools
   for helping to convey the changes you are suggesting.

4. A brief **explanation of why this change would be useful**.


## 3. Making a Code Contribution! 📝
If you are able, a code contribution to the repository is a
great way to help out and make the changes you want to see in
the project! Before making a code contribution it may be helpful
to have a read of [the codebase summary](docs/CODEBASE.md) to
familiarise yourself with the project better.

To submit a code contribution please create a **new pull request**
containing your changes. Your pull request **must** reference the
issue/s related to the changes you are proposing.

> To reiterate, **all** pull requests **must** reference an issue.
> If no issue exists for the changes you have made, please
> create one before submitting your pull request.

### Pull Requests
When submitting a pull request, please include the following
information:

1. A **link to the issue** the changes are related to.

2. A brief description of the changes you have made.

3. If your changes only address a subset of the changes discussed
   in the issue, then please specify exactly which changes you have
   made. A brief reason for why you have not addressed the whole
   issue would also be appreciated, but is not required.

### Commits
When making code changes, please combine commits together logically.
Pull requests that contain several commits for a small change will
not be merged.

Additionally, please include the issue number at the start of the
commit message. For example, a good commit message could be
_"#64: Add a back to menu button to the win screen"_.
